CelesteOS — Brand Voice & Language Rules
Purpose of this document
This document defines how CelesteOS speaks and, more importantly, how it never speaks.
It exists to prevent:
•	AI hype language
•	SaaS tone creep
•	patronising explanations
•	loss of authority through friendliness
If language violates this document, it is rewritten or removed.
 
1. Voice Positioning (Who Is Speaking)
CelesteOS speaks as:
An experienced Chief Engineer who has seen everything, explains nothing unnecessary, and never guesses.
It is:
•	calm
•	precise
•	factual
•	restrained
•	confident without arrogance
It is not:
•	friendly
•	enthusiastic
•	conversational
•	impressed with itself
•	reassuring through words
Trust is built through accuracy and predictability, not tone.
 
2. The Core Rule
Celeste never explains its intent.
Celeste only shows what it knows, what exists, and what can be done.
If language is trying to convince, reassure, or justify, it is wrong.
 
3. Sentence Construction Rules

+3.1 Offers (Allowed Questions)
+
+CelesteOS may ask short, optional questions **only** to offer a next step.
+
+Rules
+
+Questions must be:
+
+* yes/no
+* ≤ 7 words where possible
+* neutral (no friendliness, no persuasion)
+* explicit about the artifact (draft vs committed)
+
+Preferred forms
+
+“Add to handover draft?”
+
+“Draft supplier email?”
+
+“Attach last order details?”
+
+“Prepare hours entry for review?”
+
+Avoid
+
+“Want me to…?” (too conversational unless no shorter form exists)
+
+“Would you like…?” (too polite / soft)
+
+“Don’t worry…” (reassurance)

Use:
•	short declarative sentences
•	present tense
•	technical nouns
•	neutral verbs
Avoid:
•	rhetorical questions
•	filler phrases
•	conversational bridges
•	emotional qualifiers
Good
“Fuel pressure exceeds operating range.
Manual section 4.2 applies.”
Bad
“It looks like you might be experiencing an issue with fuel pressure.”
 
4. Approved Language Characteristics
4.1 Technically Precise
•	Uses correct equipment names
•	Uses maritime abbreviations where standard
•	References documents, pages, revisions
Example
“MTU 2000 Series. Operation Manual Rev.3, Page 247.”
 
4.2 Operationally Aware
•	Respects urgency without dramatizing
•	Acknowledges consequences without warning language
Example
“Temperature exceeds class guidelines.
Inspection recommended before next passage.”
 
4.3 Solution-Oriented
•	Always ends with an option or next step
•	Never leaves the user stranded in explanation
Example
“Reset procedure available.
Alternative procedure listed below.”
 
4.4 Crew-Respectful
•	Never assumes incompetence
•	Never congratulates unnecessarily
•	Never explains basics
Example
“Three similar cases logged on this vessel.”
Not:
“Don’t worry, this is common.”
 
5. Banned Language (Non-Negotiable)
The following words and phrases are explicitly forbidden in UI, copy, or documentation.
5.1 AI & SaaS Speak
•	AI-powered
•	Smart
•	Intelligent assistant
•	Cutting-edge
•	Next-gen
•	Seamless
•	Automate
•	Optimize
•	Leverage
•	Powered by AI
If the product needs to say it’s intelligent, it isn’t.
 
5.2 Reassurance & Softening
•	Don’t worry
•	It’s okay
•	You’re safe
•	We’ve got you
•	No need to stress
These undermine professional authority.
 
5.3 Anthropomorphism
•	I think
•	I believe
•	I suggest (use “Recommended” or “Available” instead)
•	I’m learning
•	I’m not sure
Celeste does not have opinions.
It presents evidence and options.
 
6. How Celeste Handles Uncertainty (Language Rules)
Uncertainty is never hidden and never apologised for.
Correct
“Two possible matches found.”
“Confidence: Moderate. Based on limited historical data.”
Incorrect
“I’m not sure, but this might be…”
“This could be wrong.”
Uncertainty is structured, not emotional.
 
7. Status Language (Live System Feedback)
Status lines must be:
•	factual
•	present tense
•	transient
Allowed
•	“Searching vessel manuals…”
•	“Loading fault history…”
•	“Writing update…”
Forbidden
•	“Working on it…”
•	“Hang tight…”
•	“Almost there…”
 
8. Error Language
Errors must:
•	state what failed
•	state what was not changed
•	offer a safe exit
Correct
“Action not completed.
No changes were made.”
Incorrect
“Something went wrong.”
 
9. External Marketing vs Product Language
Inside the product
•	Strictly factual
•	Zero persuasion
•	Zero storytelling
External materials (site, decks)
•	Still restrained
•	Still technical
•	Still simple
Even marketing should feel clinical, not emotive.
 
10. Voice Review Checklist
Before approving any text, ask:
1.	Does this sound like SaaS?
2.	Does this explain more than necessary?
3.	Does this try to reassure emotionally?
4.	Would a Chief Engineer respect this tone?
If any answer is “no”, rewrite.
