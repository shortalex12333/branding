## CelesteOS — Logo System

### Purpose of this document

This document defines **what the CelesteOS logo is**, **what it represents**, and **how it may be used**.

The logo is not decoration.
It is a **signal of authority and restraint**.

If the logo is misused, CelesteOS immediately appears like generic software.

---

## 1. What the Logo Represents

The CelesteOS logo represents:

* balance
* redundancy
* verification
* symmetry
* calibrated systems

It is intentionally abstract.

To outsiders, it is simply a mark.
To maritime professionals, it should feel **instrument-like**.

The logo does **not** represent:

* intelligence
* thinking
* AI
* creativity
* speed
* automation

If the logo is described as a “brain”, it has failed.

---

## 2. Design Philosophy

The logo follows the same philosophy as the product:

* restrained
* deliberate
* inevitable
* unemotional

It should feel:

* machined, not drawn
* engineered, not expressive
* stable, not dynamic

If the logo looks clever, it is wrong.

---

## 3. Geometry Rules (Non-Negotiable)

The logo must adhere to the following principles:

* strict bilateral symmetry
* consistent stroke weight
* intentional negative space
* clear alignment axes

There must be:

* no organic curves
* no irregular spacing
* no decorative terminals

If the logo cannot be expressed as a geometric construction, it is invalid.

---

## 4. Scale & Legibility

The logo must remain legible at:

* small sizes (app icon, favicon)
* large sizes (marketing, print)

Rules:

* no internal detail that collapses when scaled
* no thin strokes that disappear
* no reliance on color for recognition

If the logo only works large, it is wrong.

---

## 5. Color Usage

### Primary

* Solid black on light backgrounds
* Solid white on dark backgrounds

### Secondary

* Brand gradient may be used **only** in brand contexts:

  * website hero
  * launch materials
  * physical collateral

The gradient must never:

* appear inside the product UI
* be animated
* be used as decoration

If color is required for recognition, the logo is too weak.

---

## 6. Placement Rules

The logo may appear:

* at product entry (login, splash)
* on marketing materials
* on documentation covers

The logo must **not** appear:

* inside result cards
* inside microactions
* as UI decoration
* as a background pattern
* repeatedly within workflows

Presence must be **minimal and intentional**.

---

## 7. Animation Rules

Logo animation is **heavily restricted**.

Allowed:

* subtle fade-in on initial load only

Forbidden:

* rotation
* morphing
* pulsing
* looping
* reactive animation

If the logo moves, it implies instability.

---

## 8. Logo + Typography Lockup

* Logo and wordmark must never compete
* Generous spacing between mark and text
* Never stack tightly
* Never compress horizontally

The logo does not shout.
It observes.

---

## 9. What the Logo Must Never Do

The logo must never:

* act as a button
* indicate state
* signal success or failure
* be used as an icon
* be stylised per screen

One logo. One meaning.

---

## 10. Review Checklist

Before approving any logo usage, ask:

1. Does this increase authority or reduce it?
2. Is the logo being used as signal, not decoration?
3. Would this still look correct in 10 years?
4. Does this avoid SaaS aesthetics?

If any answer is “no”, reject.
