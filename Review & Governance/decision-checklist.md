## CelesteOS — Decision Checklist

### Purpose of this document

This document is the **final gate** for all product, UX, engineering, and brand decisions.

It exists to:

* prevent slow erosion of principles
* stop “reasonable” compromises
* protect CelesteOS when founders are not present

Every change — feature, UI tweak, copy edit, backend behavior — **must pass this checklist**.

If it fails, the change is rejected. No exceptions.

---

## 1. The Prime Question

Before anything else, ask:

> **Does this make the system safer and clearer for a tired professional under pressure?**

If the answer is not a confident “yes”, stop.

---

## 2. Clarity Test

Answer **yes or no**:

* Does this make system state more visible?
* Does this reduce cognitive load?
* Does this remove ambiguity rather than hide it?
* Can the user predict the outcome before acting?

If any answer is “no” → reject.

---

## 3. Consent Test

Answer **yes or no**:

* Is every state change explicitly initiated by the user?
* Is the impact visible before commitment?
* Is cancellation always safe?
* Is responsibility clearly attributable?

If any answer is “no” → reject.

---

## 4. Uncertainty Test

Answer **yes or no**:

* Does this surface uncertainty honestly?
* Are multiple interpretations preserved when present?
* Is confidence ordering maintained without forcing choice?
* Is guessing avoided?

If any answer is “no” → reject.

---

## 5. Authority Test

Answer **yes or no**:

* Does this increase trust through restraint?
* Does this avoid friendliness or persuasion?
* Does this feel calm rather than clever?
* Would a Chief Engineer respect this?

If any answer is “no” → reject.

---

## 6. SaaS Contamination Test

Answer **yes or no**:

* Does this resemble generic SaaS behavior?
* Does this add dashboards, menus, or modules?
* Does this rely on novelty, animation, or delight?
* Does this explain itself unnecessarily?

If any answer is “yes” → reject.

---

## 7. Automation Test

Answer **yes or no**:

* Does this auto-execute actions?
* Does it collapse multiple steps into one?
* Does it infer intent without confirmation?
* Does it hide side effects?

If any answer is “yes” → reject.

---

## 8. Accountability Test

Answer **yes or no**:

* Is every mutation recorded?
* Is the record immutable?
* Is the actor identifiable?
* Would this hold up in an audit or incident review?

If any answer is “no” → reject.

---

## 9. Longevity Test

Answer **yes or no**:

* Would this still feel correct in 10 years?
* Does this avoid trends and fashions?
* Does this resist future feature creep?
* Does this reinforce the core system model?

If any answer is “no” → reject.

---

## 10. The Final Gate

If a proposal passes **every section above**, it may proceed.

If it fails **any single test**, it does not ship.

No partial approvals.
No “we’ll fix it later”.
No exceptions for speed or pressure.
