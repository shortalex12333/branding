CelesteOS — Brand, UX & Product Canon (Master Folder Plan)

0. README.md — The Non-Negotiables

Purpose: Stop misinterpretation before it starts.

This is the first file everyone reads.

Must include:

What CelesteOS is

What CelesteOS is NOT

The Prime Directive (trust > speed > cleverness)

The hard line (no auto-execution, no hidden state, no dashboards as UI)

Hard questions it answers:

“Can I add this feature?”

“Can I simplify this flow?”

“Can I make this more helpful?”

If README says no, discussion ends.

reduce debates

shorten onboarding

protect the product when you’re not in the room

Next question (important)

Do you want to:

Write README.md first (sets tone for everything), or

Lock UX Grammar + Visual Tokens first (most fragile), or

Lock Brand Positioning + Logo rules (external-facing)?

Pick one.
