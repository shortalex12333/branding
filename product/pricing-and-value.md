## CelesteOS — Pricing & Value

### Purpose of this document

This document defines **how CelesteOS is priced**, **what that price represents**, and **why the price must not be diluted**.

Pricing is not a commercial afterthought.
It is a **signal of seriousness, accountability, and confidence**.

If pricing decisions undermine trust or attract the wrong customers, they are wrong.

---

## 1. What the Customer Is Actually Buying

Customers do not buy CelesteOS for features.

They buy it for:

* fewer night-time failures
* faster, safer fault resolution
* reduced inspection stress
* defensible maintenance records
* preserved reputation with owners and class
* sleep

CelesteOS is a **risk-reduction system**, not a productivity tool.

---

## 2. Why CelesteOS Is Expensive by Design

CelesteOS is priced at **€15k+ per vessel per year** because:

* the cost of failure is orders of magnitude higher
* the users are accountable professionals
* the system replaces fragile human memory
* the system must be trusted without persuasion

Low pricing would signal:

* disposability
* experimentation
* non-critical tooling

CelesteOS must feel **permanent**.

---

## 3. What the Price Replaces (Concrete)

The annual cost of CelesteOS is lower than:

* a single emergency vendor callout (€2k–€5k)
* one delayed departure (€10k+)
* a denied warranty claim (€20k–€100k)
* one failed inspection (€50k+)
* ongoing inefficiency from lost knowledge

Preventing **one** incident per year justifies the price.

---

## 4. Pricing Model (Authoritative)

* **Per vessel**
* **Annual commitment**
* **No per-seat pricing**
* **No usage-based pricing**

Rationale:

* accountability is vessel-wide
* shared responsibility cannot be metered
* safety systems are not pay-as-you-go

Fleet discounts may exist, but **never at the expense of seriousness**.

---

## 5. Why We Do Not Discount Aggressively

Discounting attracts:

* price-sensitive buyers
* non-critical use cases
* feature shoppers
* short-term thinking

CelesteOS is not optional software.
It is an operational layer.

If a customer negotiates primarily on price, they are likely not a fit.

---

## 6. Value Communication Rules

When communicating value:

* reference real incidents
* reference time saved
* reference stress reduced
* reference risk avoided

Never:

* list features
* mention AI
* talk about “productivity gains”
* compare checklists

Value is measured in **avoided failure**, not outputs.

---

## 7. Internal Guardrails

Internally, pricing must never be justified by:

* competitor pricing
* market averages
* SaaS benchmarks
* ARR targets

Pricing is justified by:

* operational impact
* trust requirements
* liability reduction

If we lower price, we must be explicit about **what value we are removing**.

---

## 8. When Pricing May Change (Rare)

Pricing may change only if:

* the scope of responsibility changes materially
* the risk profile of the system changes
* the customer class changes

Pricing must never change:

* to accelerate growth
* to close marginal deals
* to match competitors

---

## 9. Pricing Review Checklist

Before approving any pricing change, ask:

1. Does this preserve authority?
2. Does this attract the right customer?
3. Does this signal permanence?
4. Does this weaken trust expectations?
5. Would this pricing feel correct after a serious incident?

If any answer is “no”, reject.
